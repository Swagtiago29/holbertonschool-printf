# Welcome To Our Printf Project!
This repository houses our journey into creating a custom printf function in C, designed according to Holberton School's rigorous standards. Our goal is to replicate the functionality of the standard printf while focusing on clarity, efficiency, and adherence to best coding practices.

## What We're Working With
* Editors: We only where able to use vi, vim, or emacs to write your code.
* Compiler: We compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with some strict flags (-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format).
* File Etiquette: Every file should end with a neat newline.
* Style Standards: We follow the Betty style guidelines using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
* Coding Principles: We tried to avoid global variables and keep each file tidy with no more than 5 functions.
* Testing Setup: We've got a handy main.c for testing, but remember not to push your versionâ€”it might differ from ours.
